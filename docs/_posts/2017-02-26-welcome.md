Six Labors is a group of related open source projects huddling together for safty.

As of today we have 2 main projects.

## [Shapes](http://shapes.sixlabors.com/)

Shapes is a 2D polygon manipulation and interrogation library written in c# and targets .netstandard 1.1 making it entirely cross-platform and will run on everything from android phone, to windows desktops, to Linux servers and everything in between. 

Shapes is currently still in alpha but is being used by [ImageSharp][imagesharp]  for is line and vector drawing code.


## [Fonts](http://fonts.sixlabors.com/)

Fonts is an true type/woff compatible font loading library written in c# and targets .netstandard 1.1 making it entirely cross-platform and will run on everything from android phone, to windows desktops, to Linux servers and everything in between. 

Fonts provides text measuring, layout, and abstracted rendering systems. You just need to plugin your own rasterizer (like [ImageSharp][imagesharp]).

Fonts is currently still in alpha but is about to be used by [ImageSharp][imagesharp] for is text drawing code.
